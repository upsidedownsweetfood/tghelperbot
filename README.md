# Unnamed, modular Telegram helper bot
This bot was written to better manage a telegram meme channel, and I have decided to publish it, as I am extremely against properietary software, even in these circumnstances.

---

## How to run the project
First off, you need to use Deno as the typescript runtime.
You'll also need to set a few environment variables that are needed for the bot.

- BOT_API_ID
- BOT_API_TOKEN
- BOT_API_HASH

There are also a few reccomended ones.
- DATABASE_PATH

## QA
- Why did you make the bot this way?
    I'm a mentally ill faggot

- Why is there no automatic migration tool or ORM to ease with database operations?
    I'm not going to trust random projects that are likely to die in a month's time, or use too many NodeJS only libraries.
    I'm also against using a lot of external libraries.
